- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

Before you begin:

1. **Read the documentation**: Familiarize yourself with [INTERFACE.md](INTERFACE.md), [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md), and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. **Understand the standards**: Review [STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md) for code conventions
3. **Check existing issues**: See if someone else is already working on your idea
4. **Start small**: Consider tackling a "good first issue" if you're new to the project

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Create a new issue** with:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Steps to reproduce the bug
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (Gleam version, OS, target platform)
   - Minimal code example demonstrating the issue
   - Any relevant error messages or stack traces

### Suggesting Features

We love new ideas! For feature requests:

1. **Check the roadmap** in README.md to see if it's planned
2. **Open an issue** describing:
   - The problem you're trying to solve
   - Your proposed solution
   - Alternative solutions you've considered
   - Examples of how it would be used
   - Impact on existing functionality

### Improving Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

- Fix typos or unclear wording
- Add missing examples
- Improve existing examples
- Add clarifications based on your experience
- Update outdated information

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) v1.0.0 or later
- Erlang/OTP 26+
- Git
- Make (optional, for convenience commands)

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dream_test.git
cd dream_test

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/TrustBound/dream_test.git

# Install dependencies and build
gleam deps download
gleam build

# Run tests to verify setup
gleam test
# or
make all
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your fork
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, focused commits
- Follow the code standards (see below)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits atomic and well-described

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
make all

# Or individual steps
make build    # Compile
make test     # Run tests
make format   # Format code
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "Add feature: brief description

More detailed explanation if needed. Reference any related issues
using #issue-number."
```

#### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- First line should be 50 characters or less
- Add a blank line before detailed explanation
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

Examples:

```
Add timeout support to test runner

Implements configurable timeouts for individual tests. Tests that
exceed their timeout are marked as failed with a clear timeout
message.

Closes #123
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a pull request on GitHub.

## Code Standards

### Gleam Conventions

This project follows strict Gleam conventions outlined in [STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md). Key points:

#### No Magic

- No closures capturing outer scope in library code
- No anonymous functions in library modules
- Every function should be named and top-level
- Explicit is better than implicit

#### Imports

```gleam
// ✅ Good: Unqualified imports for commonly used functions
import dream_test/unit.{describe, it}
import dream_test/assertions/should.{or_fail_with}

// ❌ Bad: Redundant alias
import dream_test/assertions/should as should

// ✅ Good: Type imports
import dream_test/types.{type TestResult, type Status}

// ❌ Bad: Missing type keyword
import dream_test/types.{TestResult}  // This imports a constructor, not a type
```

#### Function Design

```gleam
// ✅ Good: Config records for multi-parameter functions
pub type TestConfig {
  TestConfig(
    name: String,
    timeout: Int,
    tags: List(String),
  )
}

pub fn run_test(config: TestConfig) { ... }

// ❌ Bad: Long positional argument lists
pub fn run_test(name: String, timeout: Int, tags: List(String)) { ... }
```

#### Pipe-Friendly APIs

```gleam
// ✅ Good: Data-first parameter order for pipes
pub fn equal(actual: a, expected: a) -> AssertionResult(a) { ... }

value
|> should.equal(expected)
|> or_fail_with("message")

// ❌ Bad: Expected-first (not pipe-friendly)
pub fn equal(expected: a, actual: a) -> AssertionResult(a) { ... }
```

### Avoid Common Mistakes

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for a detailed list of common mistakes and how to avoid them, including:

- Reserved words (`assert` is reserved—use `assertions` instead)
- Pattern matching in `case` expressions (use `{ ... }` for multi-line branches)
- List operations (use `list.append`, not `concat`)
- Import semantics (understand labeled arguments vs config records)

## Testing

### Writing Tests

All new functionality must include tests:

- Add tests in the appropriate `test/dream_test/` subdirectory
- Follow existing test patterns and structure
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include edge cases

Example:

```gleam
pub fn tests() {
  describe("Equality Matchers", [
    it("passes when values are equal", fn() {
      let result = 5 |> should.equal(5)

      case result {
        AssertionOk -> AssertionOk
        AssertionFailed(_) -> {
          False
          |> should.equal(True)
          |> or_fail_with("equal should pass for matching values")
        }
      }
    }),

    it("fails when values differ", fn() {
      let result = 5 |> should.equal(10)

      case result {
        AssertionFailed(_) -> AssertionOk
        AssertionOk -> {
          False
          |> should.equal(True)
          |> or_fail_with("equal should fail for non-matching values")
        }
      }
    }),
  ])
}
```

### The Matcher System

dream_test provides a comprehensive matcher system accessible through the `should.*` API. All matchers are pipe-friendly and return `AssertionResult`.

#### Available Matchers

**Equality**
- `should.equal(expected)` - Values are equal
- `should.not_equal(unexpected)` - Values are not equal

**Boolean**
- `should.be_true()` - Value is True
- `should.be_false()` - Value is False

**Option**
- `should.be_some()` - Option is Some
- `should.be_none()` - Option is None
- `should.be_some_and(matcher)` - Option is Some and inner value matches

**Result**
- `should.be_ok()` - Result is Ok
- `should.be_error()` - Result is Error
- `should.be_ok_and(matcher)` - Result is Ok and inner value matches

**Collection**
- `should.contain(item)` - List contains item
- `should.not_contain(item)` - List doesn't contain item
- `should.have_length(n)` - List has length n
- `should.be_empty()` - List is empty

**Comparison**
- `should.be_greater_than(threshold)` - Value > threshold
- `should.be_less_than(threshold)` - Value < threshold
- `should.be_at_least(minimum)` - Value >= minimum
- `should.be_at_most(maximum)` - Value <= maximum
- `should.be_between(min, max)` - min < value < max (exclusive)
- `should.be_in_range(min, max)` - min <= value <= max (inclusive)
- `should.be_greater_than_float(threshold)` - Float comparison
- `should.be_less_than_float(threshold)` - Float comparison

**String**
- `should.start_with(prefix)` - String starts with prefix
- `should.end_with(suffix)` - String ends with suffix
- `should.contain_string(substring)` - String contains substring

#### Custom Matchers

For domain-specific assertions, create custom matchers following this pattern:

```gleam
import dream_test/types.{
  type AssertionResult, AssertionFailed, AssertionFailure, AssertionOk, Location,
  CustomMatcherFailure,
}
import gleam/option.{Some}
import gleam/string

pub fn be_even(value: Int) -> AssertionResult {
  case value % 2 == 0 {
    True -> AssertionOk

    False -> {
      let payload =
        CustomMatcherFailure(
          actual: string.inspect(value),
          description: "value was odd",
        )

      AssertionFailed(AssertionFailure(
        operator: "be_even",
        message: "expected even number",
        location: Location("unknown", "unknown", 0),
        payload: Some(payload),
      ))
    }
  }
}

// Usage reads naturally:
42 |> be_even()
```

**Custom Matcher Guidelines:**
- Return `AssertionResult` (either `AssertionOk` or `AssertionFailed`)
- Use descriptive operator names
- Create appropriate `FailurePayload` variants for rich error reporting
- Keep matchers pure and side-effect free
- Name matchers with verbs that read well after `should.`

**Note:** The `matchers/` directory is for internal organization. Users should always interact with matchers through the `should.*` API
```

### Bootstrap Testing

dream_test is self-hosting. When modifying core functionality:

1. Ensure bootstrap tests in `test/dream_test/bootstrap/` still pass
2. Add bootstrap tests if you're changing foundational code
3. Run `make all` to verify both regular and bootstrap tests

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
gleam test

# Or with make
make test

# Run example tests
cd examples/math_app
gleam test
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add doc comments to all public functions and types
- Use `///` for documentation comments
- Include examples in documentation where helpful
- Document parameters, return values, and any important behavior

````gleam
/// Asserts that the actual value equals the expected value.
///
/// Returns a TestContext with the assertion result. Use with `or_fail_with`
/// to provide a custom failure message.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```gleam
/// actual_value
/// |> should.equal(expected_value)
/// |> or_fail_with("Values should be equal")
/// ```
pub fn equal(actual: a, expected: a) -> TestContext(a) { ... }
````
