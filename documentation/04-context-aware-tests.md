## Context-aware unit tests (`dream_test/unit_context`)

`unit_context` is for the cases where you want to **pass a shared value into every test** (and have hooks transform it).

If you’ve ever built a DB handle, HTTP client, fixture, or “scenario state” and wished you could thread it through tests cleanly, this is the tool.

Use `dream_test/unit_context` when you want hooks and tests to operate on a shared, strongly-typed **context value** that you control.

### `unit` vs `unit_context`: same DSL names, different data flow

`dream_test/unit_context` intentionally mirrors the `dream_test/unit` DSL. You’ll see the **same function names** (`describe`, `it`, `group`, hooks like `before_each`, etc.) so you don’t have to learn a second vocabulary.

What changes is the **shape of the suite**:

- In `unit`, `describe("name", [...])` builds a suite where `it("name", fn() { ... })` has no context parameter.
- In `unit_context`, `describe("name", seed, [...])` builds a suite where `it("name", fn(context) { ... })` receives the current context value.

In practice, “switching” between them is mostly swapping the import:

```gleam
import dream_test/unit.{describe, it}
// vs
import dream_test/unit_context.{describe, it}
```

Tip: avoid importing _both_ sets of unqualified names in the same module—`describe`/`it` would collide. Pick one DSL per test module.

This is the right tool when:

- Your setup produces values you want to pass into the test body (DB handles, fixtures, clients).
- You want to model “state” explicitly and type-safely (instead of storing it in globals or rebuilding it in every test).
- You want hooks to _transform_ the context for each test.

If you don’t need an explicit context, prefer `dream_test/unit` — it’s simpler.

For setup/teardown that spans multiple suites, use runner-level hooks in [Runner & execution model](07-runner-and-execution.md).

### The idea: context flows through the suite

- You give `describe` an initial `seed` value.
- `before_all` / `before_each` can transform that context.
- Each `it` receives the current context.

### Why the seed exists

The `seed` might look redundant at first (“why not let `before_all` create the context?”), but it’s doing an important job: it makes the **context type known when the suite is built**, before any tests run.

That matters in Gleam because:

- The test structure is built as ordinary data, and its parts (`before_each`, `it`, etc.) are typed with a concrete `context` type.
- Hooks run at test time, but the compiler needs the context type at compile time so `it("...", fn(context) { ... })` is type-checked correctly.
- Practically: it keeps context-aware suites simple and predictable—no special “first hook defines the context” rule, and no loss of type-safety.

This is the “make dependencies explicit” version of hooks: instead of setup functions writing to global state (or relying on process dictionaries), the setup returns a value, and that value is passed into the test body.

### A minimal example: counter context

```gleam
import dream_test/matchers.{be_equal, or_fail_with, should}
import dream_test/reporters/bdd
import dream_test/reporters/progress
import dream_test/runner
import dream_test/unit_context.{before_each, describe, it}

pub type Ctx {
  Ctx(counter: Int)
}

fn increment(ctx: Ctx) {
  Ok(Ctx(counter: ctx.counter + 1))
}

pub fn suite() {
  describe("Context-aware suite", Ctx(counter: 0), [
    before_each(increment),
    it("receives the updated context", fn(ctx: Ctx) {
      ctx.counter
      |> should
      |> be_equal(1)
      |> or_fail_with("expected counter to be 1 after before_each")
    }),
    // Hook can be repeated; each applies to subsequent tests.
    before_each(increment),
    it("sees hook effects for subsequent tests", fn(ctx: Ctx) {
      ctx.counter
      |> should
      |> be_equal(2)
      |> or_fail_with("expected counter to be 2 after two before_each hooks")
    }),
  ])
}

pub fn main() {
  runner.new([suite()])
  |> runner.progress_reporter(progress.new())
  |> runner.results_reporters([bdd.new()])
  |> runner.exit_on_failure()
  |> runner.run()
}
```

### Grouping + hook scoping (`group`)

`unit_context.group` is the same idea as `unit.group`: it lets you nest structure, and it scopes hooks.

- Hooks declared in an **outer scope** apply inside nested groups.
- Hooks declared in an **inner group** apply only to tests in that group.

```gleam
import dream_test/matchers.{be_equal, or_fail_with, should}
import dream_test/reporters/bdd
import dream_test/reporters/progress
import dream_test/runner
import dream_test/unit_context.{before_each, describe, group, it}

pub type Ctx {
  Ctx(counter: Int)
}

fn inc(ctx: Ctx) {
  Ok(Ctx(counter: ctx.counter + 1))
}

pub fn suite() {
  describe("Context-aware grouping", Ctx(counter: 0), [
    // This outer hook applies everywhere under this describe, including groups.
    before_each(inc),

    group("inner group", [
      // This hook only applies to tests inside this group.
      before_each(inc),

      it("sees both outer + inner hooks", fn(ctx: Ctx) {
        ctx.counter
        |> should
        |> be_equal(2)
        |> or_fail_with("expected counter to be 2 (outer + inner before_each)")
      }),
    ]),

    it("sees only outer hook", fn(ctx: Ctx) {
      ctx.counter
      |> should
      |> be_equal(1)
      |> or_fail_with("expected counter to be 1 (outer before_each only)")
    }),
  ])
}

pub fn main() {
  runner.new([suite()])
  |> runner.progress_reporter(progress.new())
  |> runner.results_reporters([bdd.new()])
  |> runner.exit_on_failure()
  |> runner.run()
}
```

### Important Gleam detail: when type inference needs help

In a context-aware test, you’ll often access record fields like `ctx.counter` or `context.world`.
Gleam can only allow record-field access when it knows the record type, so sometimes you need a minimal type hint:

- `fn my_step(context: StepContext) { ... context.world ... }`

That’s not “extra ceremony” — it’s the smallest annotation needed for record field access.

### When to prefer plain `unit` instead

`unit_context` is great when setup produces something you want to reuse. But it’s not “better” by default.

Prefer `dream_test/unit` when:

- Your setup is tiny and reads well inline.
- You don’t need hooks to transform shared state.
- The context would just become another “thing you have to understand” without providing leverage.
