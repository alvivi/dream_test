# Funding

## About TrustBound

**dream_test** is developed and funded by [TrustBound.ai](https://trustbound.ai).

TrustBound builds security infrastructure for AI systems. Our trust proxy acts as an intelligent boundary between clients and AI services—enforcing that sensitive data stays where it belongs and only authorized information crosses the wire. We offer a production-ready secure chat application and an API platform that gives AI companies the tools to handle data responsibly and maintain compliance without slowing down development.

We believe in giving back to the communities that make our work possible.
