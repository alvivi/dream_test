## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- **Test tagging and filtering** (`dream_test/unit`, `dream_test/runner`)

  - `with_tags()` function to tag unit tests for categorization
  - `RunnerConfig.test_filter` predicate for selective test execution
  - Filter by tags, name, kind, or any `SingleTestConfig` field
  - Works with both flat mode (`run_all`) and suite mode (`run_suite`)
  - Unified tagging across unit tests and Gherkin scenarios

- **`succeed()` function** (`dream_test/assertions/should`)

  - Explicit success counterpart to `fail_with()` for conditional branches
  - Use in `case` expressions where all branches must return `AssertionResult`
  - Recommended over importing `AssertionOk` directly in user code

- **Gherkin/Cucumber BDD Support**

  - Full Cucumber-style Given/When/Then testing with typed step definitions
  - Inline DSL for defining features directly in Gleam (`feature`, `scenario`, `given`, `when`, `then`)
  - `.feature` file parser supporting standard Gherkin syntax
  - Step registry with radix trie for O(words) step lookup
  - Typed placeholders: `{int}`, `{float}`, `{string}`, `{word}`
  - Prefix/suffix support for placeholders (e.g., `${float}` matches `$19.99`)
  - World state management with ETS-backed mutable scenario state
  - Background steps for shared setup across scenarios
  - Tag support for filtering scenarios (`@smoke`, `@slow`, etc.)
  - Scenario Outline with Examples table expansion
  - Data tables and doc strings in steps
  - Gherkin-style reporter with scenario-level output

- **Feature Discovery** (`dream_test/gherkin/discover`)

  - Builder pattern for loading `.feature` files with glob patterns
  - `features()` → `with_registry()` → `to_suite()` fluent API
  - Graceful error handling for parse failures

- **Per-Test Timing** (`dream_test/timing`)

  - Human-readable duration formatting (ms, s, m, h)
  - Per-test and total duration in BDD and Gherkin reporters
  - Monotonic time measurement for accurate elapsed time

- **JSON Reporter** (`dream_test/reporter/json`)

  - Machine-readable JSON output for CI/CD integration
  - `format` and `format_pretty` for string output
  - `report` and `report_pretty` for pipeline integration
  - Includes system info (OS, OTP version, Gleam version)
  - Detailed failure payloads with expected/actual values
  - Composable with BDD reporter for dual output

### Dependencies

- Added `gleam_regexp` dependency for step pattern tokenization
- Added `gleam_json` dependency for JSON reporter

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive Gherkin/BDD section to README
- Added JSON reporter section to README
- Added shopping cart example in `examples/shopping_cart/`
- Added Gherkin and JSON reporter snippets in `examples/snippets/`
- Updated feature status table with Gherkin/Cucumber BDD and JSON Reporter
- Added custom matchers documentation with example snippet
- Updated hexdocs for all new public functions

## [1.0.3] - 2025-12-01

### Changed

- **Improved Pipeline Composability**
  - `report` now returns results, enabling cleaner pipelines:
    `run_all() |> report(io.print) |> exit_on_failure()`

### Documentation

- Added "CI integration" section to README with `exit_on_failure` examples
- Updated Quick Start example to demonstrate full pipeline with exit codes
- Added "CI exit codes" to the feature status table

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-01

### Added

- **Test Skipping**

  - New `skip` function as an analog to `it` for temporarily disabling tests
  - Simply change `it` to `skip` to skip a test; the body is preserved but not executed
  - Skipped tests appear with `-` marker in output and are counted in summary

- **Exit Code Handling**

  - New `exit_on_failure` function exits with code 1 if any tests failed
  - New `has_failures` function to check if test results contain failures
  - Proper CI integration: test suites now fail builds when tests fail

- **AssertionSkipped Result Type**
  - New `AssertionSkipped` variant in `AssertionResult` for skip support

### Documentation

- Added "Skipping tests" section to README with examples
- Added new `skipping_tests.gleam` snippet in `examples/snippets/test/`

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-01

### Changed

- **Documentation Improvements**
  - All README code examples are now backed by tested source files
  - Each snippet has its own file in `examples/snippets/test/` for stable linking
  - Added Quick Start example with string utilities
  - README code blocks now include 🧪 links to verified source

### Removed

- Removed redundant `examples/math_app/` and `examples/string_app/` directories
- Consolidated all README examples into `examples/snippets/`

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-30

### Added

  - `describe` and `it` blocks for BDD-style test organization
  - Nested describe blocks with proper scoping
  - Test tagging and filtering support

- **Assertions Module** (`dream_test/assertions/should`)

  - Fluent assertion API with `should()` builder
  - `or_fail_with` for custom failure messages
  - Chainable assertion pattern

- **Matchers**

  - `equality` - `equal`, `not_equal`, `be_same_as`
  - `boolean` - `be_true`, `be_false`
  - `comparison` - `be_greater_than`, `be_less_than`, `be_at_least`, `be_at_most`
  - `string` - `contain`, `start_with`, `end_with`, `match_pattern`
  - `collection` - `be_empty`, `have_length`, `contain_element`, `contain_exactly`
  - `option` - `be_some`, `be_none`, `unwrap_some`
  - `result` - `be_ok`, `be_error`, `unwrap_ok`, `unwrap_error`
